SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
(with the right to link to other software)
Bruker Daltonik GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "Licensor") has developed the software program
TDF Software Development Kit (hereinafter referred to as “Software”),
which consists of software libraries (hereinafter referred to as “Software Libraries”), as well as
documentation, header files and example programs. These license terms constitute an agreement (hereinafter
referred to as the "Agreement") between you and Licensor and shall be the legal basis for any noncommercial
or commercial usage of Licensor’s Software. These license terms also apply to any updates or
supplements for the Software or separable parts of the Software such as Software Libraries, unless other
terms accompany those items, in which case those terms apply.
You may only use the Software as a whole, if you have downloaded it from Licensor’s Webserver at
https://www.bruker.com/service/support-upgrades/software-downloads/mass-spectrometry.html
and accepted this Agreement as binding between Licensor and you. However, certain individual Software
Libraries might be conveyed to you by others. In both cases, you may only legally use Software or any of the
Software Libraries conveyed to you after having accepted this Agreement as binding between Licensor and
you.
1. Purpose of Software and License
The Software is provided as it is, without any warranties regarding fitness for any purpose whatsoever. It may
contain errors and defects. It is, inter alia but not limited to, not designed, manufactured or intended for any
use requiring fail-safe performance in which the failure of the Software could lead to death, personal injury or
physical and environmental damage, such as the operation of medical facilities. Nor is it, inter alia but not
limited to, designed to perform any queries or operations which might require reliable results and/or which
might be the basis for business and/or medical decisions. You agree not to use the Software in connection
with any such activities.
2. Rights Granted
2.1 You may install and use the Software on any of your computing devices.
2.2 You may commercially exploit products that require the usage of or link to the Software Libraries and
files as defined in section 4.3. Commercial exploitation includes, but is not limited to, charging a purchase
price, license fee, maintenance fee, or subscription fee.
3. Use Restrictions
3.1 You may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or modify the Software.
3.2 You may not distribute the Software to others, breach of which terminates the rights granted under this
Agreement. This also applies to any integration or implementation of the Software to software developed by
you or by others on your behalf (hereinafter referred to as “Own Software”) or any distribution of which the
Software is part. However, you may distribute Own Software which requires the usage of or links to Software Libraries if
you comply with the requirements set down in Section 4 of this Agreement.
4. Requirements for Distribution of your own Software using Software Libraries
You may only distribute Software Libraries to others if all of the following conditions are met:
4.1 You distribute Software Libraries as part of Own Software which you license to third parties (hereinafter "Your
Licensees");
4.2 Your Own Software requires all the Software Libraries distributed by you in order to function properly when used by
Your Licensees;
4.3 You may distribute only those Software Libraries and files specifically listed in the redist.txt file inside the
Software distribution archive; furthermore, there are several files that you must distribute, also listed in the
redist.txt file.
4.4 In your Own Software’s “About” box the following text is displayed: “This software uses Software software. Copyright
© 2019 by Bruker Daltonik GmbH. All rights reserved.”
5. Restrictions for Distribution of your own Products
5.1 You may not use the Licensor’s trademarks in a way that suggests your software components and/or programs are
provided by or are endorsed by the Licensor.
5.2 Your rights to the Software do not include any license, right, power or authority to subject the Software in whole
or in part to any of the terms of an Excluded License. "Excluded License" means any license that requires as a condition
of use, modification and/or distribution of software that such software or other software combined and/or distributed
with such software shall be (a) disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (b) licensed for the purpose of making
derivative works. Without limiting the foregoing obligation, you are specifically prohibited from distributing the
Software or Software Libraries with any software that is subject to the GNU General Public License (GPL) or similar
license in a manner that would create a combined work.
6. Liability
6.1 As Licensor delivers the software for free, Licensor is not liable for any kind of damage, direct or indirect, which
may arise due to simple negligence (Section 521 German Civil Code). In the event, that there should be – for whatever
reason – a statutory liability of Licensor for simple negligence, the aforementioned exclusion of liability applies
nevertheless, but with the exception of damages to life, body or health.
6.2 You indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Licensor from any liability claims, including attorney fees, of third
parties in connection with any usage of the Software as well as the distribution of your Own Software which requires
usage of or links to Software Libraries and other circumstances for which you are responsible.
7. Additional Terms Applicable to the Software
7.1 The Software is licensed, not sold. This License only gives you some rights to use the Software and the Software
Libraries; the Licensor reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite
this limitation, you may use the Software and the Software Libraries only as expressly permitted in this License.
7.2 Licensor has no obligation to fix, update, supplement or support the Software and/or the Software Libraries.
7.3 Your rights under this License terminate automatically if you breach this License in any way. Termination of this
License will not affect any of your obligations or liabilities arising prior to termination. The following sections of
this License shall survive termination: 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, and 6.2.
7.4 No subsidiary agreements of this Agreement have been made. Supplements and amendments to this Agreement must be made
in writing as prescribed by law in order to be valid. The requirement of written form under this Agreement may be waived
in writing only.
7.5 This Agreement is governed by German law to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods. If you are a consumer, this does not apply if legal provisions, in particular consumer protection
legislation, conflict with this choice. The courts of Bremen shall have exclusive jurisdiction. If you are not a
merchant, a legal entity under public law or a public-law special fund in the sense Section 38 of the German Code of
Civil Procedure (ZPO), the agreement on the place of jurisdiction is replaced by the legal provisions.
7.6 If individual provisions of this Agreement are or become invalid or contain a gap which needs to be filled, the
validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement will not be affected thereby. The Parties hereby undertake to
substitute the invalid or lacking provision with a valid provision which comes closest to the documented intentions of
the Parties.
